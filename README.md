## Movie Hunter 

##### This page, Movie Hunter, using the Tmdb API, allows you to search for movies, view information about the movie such as original title, year, genre, subject, rating and number of reviews, and add it to the watchlist. Movies with adult content are displayed with the +18 badge. Click on the movie and the trailer will be displayed in the modal. Deleting a movie from the watchlist can be done with a cross or by clicking the bookmark again. Although the project can be developed, the first version has been prepared and shared to continue.
